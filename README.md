For this project, we were tasked with examining the training schedule of Olympic gymnasts at the National Sports Center. Our main objective was to devise a strategy to optimize the training day and enhance the quality of service for gymnasts within a specific budget. We used R-studio software, simulation packages, and the Markdown tool to model the problem.

The repository has three kinds of files:

1. Excel Data
2. R files with the code
3. PDF project report
